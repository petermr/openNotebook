Communal methods and links to sub-projects using OpenNotebookScience

## Opennotebook science
The term ["OpenNotebookScience"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science) (ONS)  was conceived and popularised by [Jean-Claude Bradley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Bradley)

## motivation
Catalyzed by several things:

### quantum chemistry
Leonie Mueck suggested this topic for the eLifeSprint in Cambridge 20190904. My emphasis in QChem is computation of chemical properties
(mainly molecules and crystals) using Schroedinger's equation. 

See https://github.com/petermr/quantumchem which has a good example of how to create a dictionary from Wikipedia page.

## shared resources
These projects will all be using the same resources and so documentation can be done here and shared. 

## TIGR2ESS
The tools were developed for and used in the [TIGR2ESS workshop in New Delhi 20190228](https://github.com/petermr/tigr2ess/). We'll often point to the tutorials there, but rememebr they were developedfor a particular, real-life,  occasion and a specific subject (crops (rice, wheat, millets)).
