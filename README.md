Communal methods and links to sub-projects using OpenNotebookScience

## Opennotebook science
The term ["OpenNotebookScience"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science) (ONS)  was conceived and popularised by [Jean-Claude Bradley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Bradley)

## motivation
Catalyzed by several things:

### quantum chemistry
Leonie Mueck suggested this topic for the eLifeSprint in Cambridge 20190904. PMR emphasis in QChem is computation of chemical properties
(mainly molecules and crystals) using Schroedinger's equation. 
(BTW QChem is used to compute the properties of many biological molecules, including proteins and nucleic acids so it's mainstream bioscience!)

See https://github.com/petermr/quantumchem which has a good example of how to create a dictionary from Wikipedia page.

### climate change
PeterMR and Simon Worthington met virtually and are creatin a shared OpenScience project for mining papers on climate chane - EPMC has > 65K open access papers.

See https://github.com/petermr/climate which has a good example of how to create a dictionary of 230+ terms from Wikipedia page.

(climate is critically part of bioscience!)

### medicinal plants
Work with Gita Yadav (NIPGR India and Cambridge) and Emanuel Faria (Verriclear) on essential oils and their reported activities.

See https://github.com/petermr/CEVOpen which will use recent semantic plant and chemical dictionaries from the EssoilDB project in NIPGR..

## shared resources
These projects will all be using the same resources and so documentation can be done here and shared. 

## TIGR2ESS
The tools were developed for and used in the [TIGR2ESS workshop in New Delhi 20190228](https://github.com/petermr/tigr2ess/). We'll often point to the tutorials there, but rememebr they were developedfor a particular, real-life,  occasion and a specific subject (crops (rice, wheat, millets)).
