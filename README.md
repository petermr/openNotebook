## Opennotebook science
The term ["OpenNotebookScience"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science) (ONS)  was conceived and popularised by [Jean-Claude Bradley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Bradley)

## motivation
Catalyzed by several things:

### quantum chemistry
Leonie Mueck suggested this topic for the eLifeSprint in Cambridge 20190904. My emphasis in QChem is computation of chemical properties
(mainly molecules and crystals) using Schroedinger's equation. 

See https://github.com/petermr/quantumchem which has a good example of how to create a dictionary from Wikipedia page.
